1. Develop demo data from [DuckTrack](https://github.com/TheDuckAI/DuckTrack) (just record some work for a while)
2. Create simulation data for Salesforce
3. Create xgboost pipeline (combine ducktrack recordings and sf sim data) or correlation analysis
4. Import data to salesforce
5. Salesforce integration
6. Plug SF integration to xgboost pipeline
7. Quick UI

This correlation is obviously very wrong. This is all sim data.
