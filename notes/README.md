> To use this directory in the intended format, open `../notes` as a vault in Obsidian. Feel free to use the raw markdown files as well.

These notes are designed to help centralize the things we learn about Bridge, and adjacent technologies.

`./meetings` - product discussions, meetings on relevant technologies, etc.
`./repo` - implementation notes, repository info, etc.
`./research` - since this is a research-heavy project, we are giving research its own category.
`./other` - misc.
