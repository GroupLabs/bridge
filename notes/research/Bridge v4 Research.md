We are building the integrative core that has a human-level system understanding. The first objective is to prove capabilities of semantic understanding of information contained in different data formats.

> By "understanding" I only mean that it is reasonably able to transduce information from natural to machine language.

So far, there are transformer-based models that are widely known to have a strong enough understanding of natural language to (arbitrarily) pass a Turing test. We explore this in the next section.
