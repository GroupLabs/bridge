- What are the different kinds of attention we need to explore?
- How can we make it long form?

## Disclaimer

Interestingly having extra special characters wildly changes the output. For example, "What's best for many passengers?" returns bus, while "What's best for many passengers??" returns airplane. Perhaps there needs to be some preprocessing to normalize input vectors.
