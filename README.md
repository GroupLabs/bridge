# Bridge

> The notes directory is compatible with Obsidian. To use this with Obsidian, open the directory as an Obsidian vault from within the app. Run the notes-vcs.py to synchronize notes across the repo with the vault (under development).

> The dev folder holds experiments, and related non-production ready code.

# Overview
A tool designed to harmonize various components of a software system, whether it’s
interfacing with databases, calling ML models, or invoking software subsystems. Much like
a central nervous system, Bridge acts as the integrative core, coordinating and responding
to the diverse needs of the software environment.
# Why?
The founding team experienced data analytics in large enterprises first hand. This
experience helped us understand different misalignments in data collection, storage,
aggregation, and analysis.
A data analytics team has a single objective: to transform collected data to actionable
insights that improve business efficiency. In practice, this means that the team needs to
define the right target, find appropriate data sources, filter for relevant factors, clean and
model data, and maintain models. With the emergence of big data, it becomes
increasingly challenging to comprehensively track and analyze all data across an
enterprise. This complexity poses a significant hurdle for large organizations.

Our revolutionary platform is engineered to automatically discover and retrieve highly
relevant and accurate information. Bridge stands as a pivotal solution in the data analytics
landscape, bridging the gap between the overwhelming volume of data and the critical
need for precision in data utilization. Its advanced AI-driven approach ensures that
organizations can harness the full potential of their data, empowering them to make more
informed decisions and uncover hidden opportunities.
# Roadmap
To reach our envisioned final state for Bridge, we have charted a path that prioritizes the
development of the following capabilities, in sequence:
Short - Term ( 3 - 4 months )
1. Semantic Data Understanding - Extract accurate and highly relevant information from
expansive datasets of structured and unstructured data.
2. System Understanding and Management - Efficiently manage, invoke, and execute
systems and functions.
3. Context Awareness - Improve by considering situational factors such as who the user is,
what is important, what is urgent, and so on.
Medium - Term ( 5 - 8 months )
4. Assumption Articulation - Clearly define assumptions and transparently communicate
the underlying rationale, ensuring predictability, interpretability, and trustworthiness.
Long - Term ( 12 months )
5. Action & Insight Generation - Generate informed actionable steps or provide insightful
recommendations, empowering users with clarity and direction.
