# List of bugs

1. trying to load model. It successfully lods the model, but an error is raised 30 seconds after.

2. the load model enpoint succesfully accepts models but they do not actually get added to Azure (for Damian, maybe a Windows issue)

3. Loading a PDF does not upload to ElasticSearch for Damian. Error occurs while unzipping a tesseract library file.
