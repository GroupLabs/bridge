Use this frontend as a testing ground. There are some components here that we have yet to implement! Have fun!

## How to use

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-openai next-openai-app
```

```bash
yarn create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-openai next-openai-app
```

```bash
pnpm create next-app --example https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/examples/next-openai next-openai-app
```

To run the example locally you need to:

1. Sign up at [OpenAI's Developer Platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
2. Go to [OpenAI's dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create an API KEY.
3. Set the required OpenAI environment variable as the token value as shown [the example env file](./.env.local.example) but in a new file called `.env.local`
4. `pnpm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. `pnpm dev` to launch the development server.
